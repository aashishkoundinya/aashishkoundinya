### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Aashish ðŸ˜„

I'm a 3rd-year engineering student who enjoys learning new technologies and working on interesting projects. I'm especially interested in Backend Development and DevOps but in the process ended up learning Full-Stack Development. I like building things that solve real problems. Milkshakes usually keep me going while I code, and when I'm not coding, you might find me playing games and exploring virtual worlds.
